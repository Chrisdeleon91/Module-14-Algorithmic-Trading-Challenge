# Module-14-Algorithmic-Trading-Challenge

In this module, I learned how to use Pandas and the JupyterLab IDE to collect, prepare and analyze financial data.

For this Challenge, I’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. My firm constantly
competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, my firm has heavily
profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.
The speed of these transactions gave my firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which
limits their ability to adapt to new data. I am thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive
advantage in the market. To do so, I’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.
I’ll combine your new algorithmic trading skills with your existing skills in financial Python programming and machine learning to create an
algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.
